## TO CONTRIBUTORS
* Main objective is to have the website be 100% usable without Javascript. That means all our content should be viewable without it. Javascript can still be used just not for loading content.
* Please keep styling seperate from `.html` files by putting it in a `.css` file instead to keep code clean
* Keep all non-html and non-css content in the `res` folder
* Only edit the files under `pages` to add or modify content unless more pages are being added or the templates were updated.
* Please make sure the website still looks fine and is usable before creating a pull request or pushing to this repo.
